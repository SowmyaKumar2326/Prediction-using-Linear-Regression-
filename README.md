# Project-on-Linear-Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
The most common form of linear regression is simple linear regression, which involves only one independent variable. The equation of a simple linear regression line is given by:y=mx+c
Here y is the dependent variable,x is the independent variable,m is the slope of the graph and c is the constant.
# Overview of the project
This repository cotains the process of predicting the 'Delivery Time' based on 'Sorting Time.
# Steps of Evaluation
## 1.Jupyter Notebook
Using Jupyter Notebook the data is downloaded,basic information check is done.The EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) helps in visualising the data and the correlation between the columns.Linear Regression model is built.
## 2.MS-Excel
Data is downloaded to excel,From the DataAnalysis the values of constant,slope and R2_score or 'Coefficient of Determination' is calculated.
# Results
## The projects achievement can be summed on basis of
1.R2_Score-The model's ability to explain the variance or divergence.
2.RMSE-The average prediction error.
The model with train_test_split 80:20 accomplished with R2_score 84.01% and RMSE value of 1.58.
