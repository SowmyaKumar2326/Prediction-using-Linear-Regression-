# Project-on-Linear-Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
The most common form of linear regression is simple linear regression, which involves only one independent variable. The equation of a simple linear regression line is given by:y=mx+c
Here y is the dependent variable,x is the independent variable,m is the slope of the graph and c is the constant.
